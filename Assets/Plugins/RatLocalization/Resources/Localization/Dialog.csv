D1.Char1.Dialog1.NPC.Line1.Choice3.Line2,"Let me see if I got this straight: you expect me, a woman this beautiful and busy, to wait until the little boy feels ready to talk?",,
D1.Char1.Dialog1.NPC.Line1.Choice3.Line3,"Boy, if I still needed permission to speak, I’d be betraying everything I’ve fought for. Get yourself together.",,

D1.Char1.Dialog3.NPC.Line2,Thank you.,,
D1.Char1.Dialog4.NPC.Line1,"I wanted passion on a plate, and you brought me… polite confusion. Try again. Seduction takes practice.",,

D2.Char1.Dialog1.NPC.Line2,"It’s always the same story now. Young people out at absurd hours, chasing noise instead of peace. As if the dark were a friend.",,
D2.Char1.Dialog1.NPC.Line3,"When I was their age, the night was for sleeping. For dreaming. Or, if you were lucky, for whispering things you’d never dare say in daylight.",,

D3.Char1.Dialog1.NPC.Line1,"Ah, there you are, my sweet soul.",,
D3.Char1.Dialog1.NPC.Line2,I don’t have much time today — the streets are louder than usual. Something about sirens and silly boys chasing ghosts.,,
D3.Char1.Dialog1.NPC.Line3,Before I go — allow me one last selfish act: a piece of advice.,,
D3.Char1.Dialog1.NPC.Line4,"When love knocks, don’t ask it to wait. Don’t tell it to come back later. Whatever it asks of you — attention, change, even silence — it is only ever demanding one thing: to be taken seriously.",,

D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice1.Line6,…Tch. You know what’s funny? We were married for 28 years. ,,

D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice2.Line4,"Carlito. That’s my name. Used to mean something. 
Now I’m just the guy whose wife walked out on him.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice2.Line5,"So… what happened, if you don’t mind me asking?",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice2.Line6,"What happened?  Well, apparently I’m “emotionally unavailable” and “stuck in the past.” Imagine that.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice2.Line7,"A man who paid bills, fixed everything, stayed faithful, and somehow I’m the problem. She wanted to grow, she said. I didn’t know that meant growing away. I feel <color=#{$AngryColor}>betrayed</color>.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice3.Preview,"Fine. If you don’t wanna talk, that’s your problem.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice3.Line1,"Fine. If you don’t wanna talk, that’s your problem.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice3.Line2,"Typical. No patience, no spine. This generation runs from discomfort like it's fire.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice3.Line3,"Don’t worry, I’ll talk to the wall instead. At least it doesn’t pretend to care.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice3.Line5,"Carlito’s the name. Fifty-three. Alone. But hey, enjoy your walk through the ruins.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice3.Line6,Sounds like you’re still hurting.,,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice3.Line7,"…Yeah, I am.  And I hate it.  I keep walking past the chair she used to sit in, like she’s still gonna be there.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice3.Line8,"Sometimes I even talk to it. Pathetic, right? Turns out, the silence is the loudest part of losing someone. I don't know... I feel <color=#{$AngryColor}>betrayed</color>.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line3,"I’ll cook something for you, Carlito. We can’t solve anything on an empty stomach.",,
D1.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line4,I’m sure everything will seem clearer once you’ve eaten.,,
D1.Char2.Dialog2.NPC.Line1,Left at the table again… starting to feel like a habit.,,
D1.Char2.Dialog3.Player.Line1,Here it is!,,
D1.Char2.Dialog3.NPC.Line2,Hm. Let's see.,,
D1.Char2.Dialog4.NPC.Line1,"Nah. I’m not eating that. If I wanted something half-done and all mixed up, I’d just go back to my marriage, eh.{wc}Don’t make me more mad than I already am, capisce? Next week, I’m signing those damn divorce papers, and I need at least a proper meal, okay? And on top of that, I already paid — so serve me like I deserve.",,

D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line1,Funny thing... I used to come here when things were good. When I had someone waiting for me at home.,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line2,Now I come here to... chew on the silence.,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line3,"I’m not angry anymore. Just... confused, I guess. I keep going over it in my head, trying to find the one thing I said, or didn’t say, that cracked it all open.",,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line4,Anyway. I’ll take whatever lunch you’ve got going today.  Nothing fancy. Just something that doesn’t ask too many questions.,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line4.Choice1.Preview,I’ll bring you something warm.,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line4.Choice2.Preview,You sound like someone who’s still hoping for a different ending.,,

D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line4.Choice2.Line2,Heh... Hope’s a slippery little thing.,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line4.Choice2.Line3,One day you’re sure the book’s closed — next day you’re reading the same damn page again.,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line4.Choice2.Line4,I don’t know if I want a different ending. Maybe I just wanted to be part of it longer.,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line4.Choice3.Preview,Want to tell me what cracked it open?,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line4.Choice3.Line1,Want to tell me what cracked it open?,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line4.Choice3.Line2,Don’t we all think we said the wrong thing? Or didn’t say enough?,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line4.Choice3.Line3,"...Truth is, I think we stopped talking about what mattered. And started timing each other’s silences instead.",,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.Player.Line5,I’ll bring you something warm. Maybe it helps you think clearer.,,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line5,"Hm. If warmth solved anything, my house wouldn’t feel like a freezer now.",,
D2.Char2.Dialog1.NPC.Line6,"...Still, thanks. I’m tired of chewing on cold thoughts. One day, the <color=#{$SadColor}>sadness</color> will end, but I don't think today's the day.",,
D2.Char2.Dialog2.NPC.Line1,"Less questions, more food. No offense.",,
D2.Char2.Dialog3.Player.Line1,Here it is!,,
D2.Char2.Dialog4.NPC.Line1,"...This hits different.{wc}You don’t always get that. Not in food. Not in people.{wc}Thanks. You got the mood right — and today, that’s more than I expected.",,
D2.Char2.Dialog5.NPC.Line1,Some meals carry too much noise. I needed quiet.{wc}Loss... has a flavor. You just have to cook slow enough to taste it.{wc}I’ll give you another shot — if you’re willing.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.Player.Line1,"Good morning, ma’am. Is everything alright?",,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line2,"Morning... I suppose that depends on what you mean by ""alright"".{wc}Some days, silence feels like peace. Today, it feels more like punishment.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice1.Preview,Would you like some company?,,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice1.Line1,Would you like some company?,,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice1.Line2,That’s… kind of you. I don’t usually accept offers from strangers. {w=0.2}But today... I’ll make an exception.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice1.Line3,My name is Giuseppina. I made a decision not long ago. One I thought would set me free. But freedom can be a cold place when there’s no one waiting on the other side.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice2.Preview,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice2.Line1,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice2.Line2,"You didn’t intrude. Sometimes, words from someone who doesn’t know the whole story are exactly what we need.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice2.Line3,"I’m Giuseppina. I left someone I shared my life with for decades. At the time, it felt like self-preservation.
Now... i'm not so sure what it was.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice3.Preview,I can relate.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice3.Line1,I get that. Loneliness has sharp teeth.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice3.Line2,"Heh… Sharp teeth. That’s a good way to put it. Yes, I’ve been bitten a few times lately... Mostly by my own thoughts.{wc}I’m Giuseppina. I walked away from a man I once thought I’d grow old with. Turns out, growing apart hurts just as much.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line3,"I keep wondering… was it the silence that hurt more, or the fact that I stopped trying to fill it..",,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line4,Anyway. I didn't come here just to bleed into someone else's morning.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog1.NPC.Line5,I’d like something that feels like… company. Not comfort food. Not guilt food. Just… <color=#{$SadColor}>something honest</color>.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog2.NPC.Line1,"I've waited through silences, through empty dinners, through years of ‘maybe tomorrow.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog3.Player.Line1,"Here it is! I hope you like it, it was made with love",,
D1.Char3.Dialog4.NPC.Line1,...This. This feels like someone listened.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog4.NPC.Line2,"You didn’t ask for my story. And yet, you served a chapter of it back to me.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog4.NPC.Line3,Thank you. For not offering answers — just presence.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog5.NPC.Line1,...I’m sure you meant well. But this… it’s loud.,,
D1.Char3.Dialog5.NPC.Line2,"I won’t hold it against you. Most people think sadness needs distraction. But sometimes, it only needs space.",,
D1.Char3.Dialog5.NPC.Line3,I’d like you to try again. If that’s not too much to ask.,,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.NPC.Line1,"Uh… hi. Sorry, I didn’t mean to just barge in. I’m looking for someone. Or... I was.",,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.NPC.Line2,"This is my first time here. I followed my neighbor, Caterina. She took off on her morning run before I could say anything. Classic.",,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice1.Preview,Why?,,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice1.Line1,You followed her? Why?,,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice1.Line2,Because she’s been waking up the whole building watching those movies! I just wanted to ask her — nicely — to turn it down. But she vanished before I could get a word in.,,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice2.Preview,Is everything okay?,,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.Player.Line2.Choice2.Line1,You seem a little tense. Everything okay?,,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.NPC.Line2.Choice2.Line2,"Yeah, well, let’s say I had a plan and it got completely derailed. Now I’m here, hungry, confused, and still kinda mad at an old lady who outran me.",,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.NPC.Line3,"You know what? Never mind Caterina. I should probably introduce myself, anyway. My name’s Leo... but in the studio, they call me Freakiest.",,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.Player.Line4,"Nice to meet you, Leo.... So, aside from Caterina, what brings you here?",,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.NPC.Line5,"So, I was born in Modena, but moved here for uni. Bologna’s got soul. It’s the kind of place where you can walk down an alley and find a jazz bar or a tattoo studio. Sometimes both.{wc}Studying product design here just feels right. Except when I’m stuck waiting for my classmate Iná, who treats every deadline like it’s a polite suggestion.",,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.NPC.Line6,"Okay, as I very well predicted — she’s gonna be late again. Told her today was booked, can’t afford to wait on her whims. Like I said, I work at a studio. I’m actually a brow model.",,
D1.Char4.Dialog1.NPC.Line7,"By the way — today’s a big one! I just landed my first four-digit contract! I’m <color=#{$PositiveColor}>buzzing</color>, honestly. Feels like things are finally lining up...{wc}I’m starving too. Hit me with the house special, will you?",,
D1.Char4.Dialog2.NPC.Line1,"Talk to me after the first bite, yeah? I’ve got exactly 12 minutes to inhale food and not ruin my contract.",,
D1.Char4.Dialog3.Player.Line1,Here it is!,,
D1.Char4.Dialog4.NPC.Line1,"Yo!! This is amazing! Looks like I’m not the only artist in the room. You really cook with your feelings, huh? I can taste the emotion. Definitely coming back for more.{wc}But hey, I gotta run now. Thanks for the food, seriously.{wc}Could you do me a favor and pass a message to Iná for me?",,
D1.Char4.Dialog5.NPC.Line1,"Ah… man. I really wanted to love this, but my stomach just filed a complaint with my brain.{wc}Listen, I know there’s greatness in there — I can smell it. You just need to remix the flavors a little. One more track, chef. Let’s make this a hit.""",,
D1.Char0.Dialog1.NPC.Line1,"Ufa… at least one face here looks… happy to see me? Or am I, uh… how you say… imagining things?..",,

D1.Char0.Dialog1.Player.Line9.Choice1.Preview,Leo would disagree,,
D1.Char0.Dialog1.Player.Line9.Choice1.Line1,Depends who you ask. Leo looked like he aged a year waiting for you.,,
D1.Char0.Dialog1.NPC.Line9.Choice1.Line2,"He’s dramatic. I’m just... in another time zone. In Porto Alegre my friends say I'm in ""Thainá Standard Time"".
You'll get used to it.",,
D1.Char0.Dialog1.Player.Line9.Choice1.Line3,I can't wait!,,
D1.Char0.Dialog1.Player.Line9.Choice2.Preview,What happened?,,
D1.Char0.Dialog1.Player.Line9.Choice2.Line1,Now I'm curious! what happened?,,
D1.Char0.Dialog1.NPC.Line9.Choice2.Line2,"Oh, just the usual. I was walking, listening to music and an old lady asked for help...{wc}She was carrying some oddly heavy bags for a lady her age to handle alone!",,
D1.Char0.Dialog1.Player.Line9.Choice2.Line3,That sounds… strange. Did she say what was inside them?,,
